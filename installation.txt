ACQ4 is written in Python and relies heavily on several free Python libraries. 
These libraries will need to be installed before starting ACQ4:

- Python 2.6 (python.org)
- PyQt 4.5 or later (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download)
- NumPy, SciPy (http://scipy.org/Download)
- Python Imaging Library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
- pyparsing (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/)
 

Once all dependencies are installed, you will also need a basic set of configuration files
that describe the devices in your system. See the files in acq4/config/backup for several 
examples.
