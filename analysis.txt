First, MosaicEditor - The purpose is to get all the images and scans in the right places. Load images - if you select the image in the list in the canvas window you can
    move and rotate it, as well as adjust its alpha level (using the alpha slider) and contrast (using the markers in the histogram). Any future images you add will have
    this same transform applied upon adding. Don't worry, all the original position information is saved. If you
    want to go back to original positions hit "Reset Transform." If you need to move the position of a scan, move an image that goes with it, select that image and
    hit "copy" then select the scan and hit "paste." 
    
    The last thing you need to do is select the Cell directory you are working from, and press 'Load File.' This will load a cell marker into the Canvas. Position
    this marker over your cell.
    
    All of the new position information will be exported to the other analysis modules.
    
    Eventually you will be able to do image editing and be able to export images, but this doesn't work yet. Also, Markers aren't implemented yet.
    
Second, PhotoStim - This module analyzes maps and stores info to databases.
