What is ACQ4?
=============

ACQ4 is a complete software system for data acquisition and analysis in neurophysiology research. The system is currently most suited for patch clamp electrophysiology, photostimulation and fluorescence imaging experiments.

Features:

* Protocol design interface allows easy creation of stimulation / recording protocols combining and synchronizing any number of devices
* Live camera viewing geared toward slice imaging for patch clamp and online analysis of calcium imaging
* Easy photostimulation mapping control
* Sophisticated data analysis system
* Integrated data manager allows easy, customizable data storage, browsing, and export.
* Designed to be a flexible, general-purpose experiment acquisition and analysis interface.
* Highly modular and scalable design--easy to expand support for new hardware and experiments
* Open source and cross-platform. Runs in Windows, Linux, and OSX (acquisition may be limited depending on your hardware, though)
