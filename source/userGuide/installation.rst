Installation
============

ACQ4 depends on several free software packages to work properly.
    
* Python 2.7
* Numpy
* Scipy
* PyQt 4.8
* h5py

These are the minimal requirements to run ACQ4 (eg, for data analysis). For data acquisition, there are extra requirements:
    
* pyparsing
* pyserial (only if using serial devices--Sutter MP285, arduino, serial mice, etc)
    
You also need to make sure that the drivers for your devices are installed and working properly. 


Windows Installation
--------------------

In Windows, there is currently no way to install all requirements in one shot (sorry, maybe later).
Download and install all prerequisites in order:
    
#. Python 2.7: http://python.org
#. PyQt4: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download  (Be sure to get the version built for python 2.7)
#. Numpy *and* Scipy: http://scipy.org/Download (look for the 'superpack' files for python 2.7)
#. h5py:  http://code.google.com/p/h5py/downloads/list   (Windows installer for Python 2.7)
#. pypasring version <=1.5.2 or >=1.5.6 http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyparsing/files/pyparsing/  
#. pyserial: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial
#. Python Imaging Library: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

I know it is tempting to use easy_install or cygwin for this. Don't. 
Once all prerequisites are installed, download ACQ4 (stable or development branch):
    
#. Download and install git: http://git-scm.com/downloads
#. Start a command shell (or powershell or cygwin, if you prefer) and download a copy of the ACQ4 code::
    
    git clone https://github.com/acq4/acq4.git
    
If all goes well, you now have everything ready and can proceed to configuration.




Linux Installation
------------------

Make all your windows-using friends jealous::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-qt4-gl python-qt4-sql python-pyserial python-scipy python-pyparsing python-h5py python-imaging git python2.7-dev
    $ git clone https://github.com/acq4/acq4.git
    
If you wish to develop modules / devices / analysis, you will probably need a few more packages: qt4-designer pyqt4-dev-tools
    
    
OSX Installation
----------------

#. Download Qt SDK (see code.activestate.com/pypm/pyqt4 for a link to their recommended qt version)
#. Download ActiveState Python (free community edition)
#. run::
    pypm install pyqt4 pyparsing h5py numpy scipy pil
#. If you get a complaint about 64-bit compatibility, run python in 32-bit mode (see manpage)

    
#. Optional:
    - find uic executable by::
        pypm files pyqt4 | grep pyuic
    - Add correct directory PATH
    - Edit pyuic4 to point correctly to pyuic.py



OSX Alternate Installation Method #1
---------------------------------

These instructions are for building on MacOSX 10.5. If you're building on 10.6 or 10.7 some of these libraries will be available as binaries. 

You will need to have xcode installed on your machine.

Download and install the following packages in order:
    
#. **Python 2.7**: http://python.org (available as a dmg)
#. | **Qt 4.7**: http://qt.nokia.com 
   | Unfortunately the SDK installation does not work on 10.5 - But installing the libraries should be fine. 
   | The libraries are available as dmg
   
#. | **SIP** (I used 4.12.3): http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/download.
   | From the SIP directory in a Terminal:
       
   ::

        $ python configure.py
        $ make
        $ make install
        
#. | **PyQt4**: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
   | Be sure to get the version built for python 2.7 and the Qt version you installed.
   | In a terminal navigate to the PyQt4 folder:
       
   ::
        
        $ python configure.py
        $ make
        $ make install
        
#. | **Numpy**: http://numpy.scipy.org
   | Make sure you get the version for python 2.7, this may involve searching through files instead of simply getting the latest version.
   | I use numpy 1.6.0 which is available as a .dmg
#. | **Scipy**: http://numpy.scipy.org
   | Same deal as numpy, I used scipy 0.9.0
#. **ZLib**: http://zlib.net ::

            $ ./configure
            $ make test
            $ sudo make install
            
#. | **Python Imaging Library (PIL)**: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil
   | Get the PIL-1.1.7.tar.gz package.
   | Unpack it and in Terminal navigate to the PIL folder and:
       
   ::

        $ python setup.py install
        
#. **PyParsing**: http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com ::

        $ python setup.py install
        
#. | **HDF5**: http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5
   | Download the source code (I used version 1.8.7).
   | Unpack it and navigate to the folder in terminal 
   
   ::

        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5
        $ make
        $ make check           # If check succeeds, go on..
        $ sudo make install
        $ make check-install
        
#. | **h5py**: http://code.google.com/p/h5py
   | I use version 1.3.1.
   | Navigate to the folder in terminal and:
       
   ::

        $ python setup.py build --hdf5=/usr/local/hdf5
        $ python setup.py install
        
#. Finally, navigate to the place where you would like to store acq4. ::

        $ bzr branch lp:acq4
        
That's it, you're done and ready to setup configuration files.


OSX Alternate Method #2 (for building without Enthought or Active State Python on Mac OSX Lion):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#. Remove all previous installations of python, with the possible exception of the basic Apple version 2.6
#. Install "Brew":
	| /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"
	| export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
	| source ~/.bash_profile
	| brew update
	::
#. | Now install some support libraries and Python:
	| (follow the directions to set things up at www.thisisthegreenroom.com)
	| brew install readline sqlite gdbm pkg-config
	| brew install python --framework --universal
	| export PATH=/usr/local/share/python:$PATH && source ~/.bash_profile
	| cd /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions
	| sudo rm Current
	| ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current

#.  Install pip as some packages are not in brew format:
	| easy_install pip

#. | Now we get to work:
	|sudo pip install numpy
	| go to http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries to get the gfortran binary for mac os x Lion. These are needed to compile scipy.
	| sudo pip install scipy
	|| (if that fails, get the dev branch: -e git+https://github.com/scipy/scipy#egg=scipy-dev)
	| brew install Qt (or install the standard Qt Libraries, but not the SDK). 

#. | Get ready and build PyQt:
	| sip: I had a problem with sip 4.13.2, so, first, get rid of potential conflicting versions.
	| brew remove sip (only needed if you have installed sip before)
	| brew remove pyqt (may fail; it might not be installed)
	| cd `brew --prefix`
	| brew versions sip
	| git checkout 042cf7a Library/Formula/sip.rb (gets 4.13.1)
	| brew install sip
	| git checkout 2bf9bba Library/Formula/pyqt.rb (gets pyqt 4.9.1)
	| brew install pyqt
	|| (remarkably, this finally ran to completion and I was able to import PyQt4 in python!)

	| Make sure to export (put these in your bash profile file):
	| export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
	| export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
	| source ~/.bash_profile

#. Get the remaining packages using pip and brew:
	| sudo pip install matplotlib
	| sudo pip install h5py
	| brew install PIL
	| sudo pip install pyparsing==1.5.2

#. Finally, navigate to the place where you would like to store acq4. ::

     bzr branch lp:acq4
        
That's it, you're done and ready to setup configuration files.
